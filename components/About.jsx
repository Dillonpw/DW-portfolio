        In 2019, after completing my college education, I took on a position as
        a 911 Emergency Dispatcher. While this role was challenging, it also
        afforded me the time to explore my interest in software development.
        Using free resources like The Odin Project and official documentation to
        learn and to hone my skills while working a full time job. Recently, my
        focus has shifted towards contributing to open source projects I use and
        their documentation, and working on Software Quality Assurance.
